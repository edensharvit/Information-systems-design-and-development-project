This project simulates a vacation management system for employees in an organization.

It contains two parts, the first one being a dashboard, where a user (employee or manager) can watch all the details relevant with his reservation and confirm, decline or change the date of his reservation.
He can also edit the number of participants, and ask for special requests (eg: kosher food, or accessibility for handicaps, etc ..)

While a manager can watch the transportation report, a regular employee with no permissions cannot watch them.

The second part of the management system intended for the usage of the manager and the office workers only.
Here,  they can watch all the details about the employees and their family members who join them, also they can change user's data if they have permission to do so.

The whole system is written in Java, using Swing.
The database made using Microsoft Access.

Since the second part of the system is too big to upload here,
